### Can you please introduce yourself and tell me a little bit about your background.

Hi there, I am Chris Heilmann. I’ve been a web developer for about 20 years, and worked with all the different parts we have to cover. I am self-taught and ended up becoming an educator myself, doing trainings, videos and writing books in addition to my work. I’ve never been to university but started right after high school as a radio journalist/newscaster before discovering the internet as a way to start a career. I’ve been at a few agencies, been head of development at a big one and then went on to work for Yahoo, Mozilla and now Microsoft. I’ve worked on many huge and diverse projects and love being now in a place where I can influence the tools and products end users surf with and developers work in.
 
### How did you get in to Javascript? Has it always been Javascript, or do you have a background in other programming languages?
 
My first programing steps were in BASIC and soon in Assembler on a Commodore 64. In school we learned Pascal, and I still don’t get why. When I started as a web developer, it was all HTML and only some basic CSS, so I needed to learn something server-side to enhance my projects. That was Perl and later PHP. When browsers became more capable, I started using JavaScript, mostly in a DHTML fashion to spruce up forms and create popup solutions. I was always taken aback by the support issues across browsers and the many ways JavaScript functionality can fail. Therefore I spent a lot of time advocating and describing “unobtrusive JavaScript” and even wrote a quite successful [self-training course](http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/) on it. I can safely say I started to take JavaScript seriously when I wrote my first book in 2005, as there is no way to fake knowledge when you have to explain what you do. 

### You work for Microsoft on the Edge team, what's that like? What does a typical day look like for you?

I work remotely, and my team is for the most part in the US. Therefore my day starts late and ends late. A lot of my job is triaging requests, filing bugs, following new trends and seeing what the competition is doing that we also should do. I am on the road a lot, so I work almost exclusively on laptops and all I need is internet access. That’s a good challenge for a company who have most people in one place. I also do a lot of work with clients helping them debug and optimise their code. The afternoons/evenings are mostly full of meetings and one on one communication with my US colleagues. I code a lot less than I use to, but I am OK with it as often a well-planned and executed meeting prevents you from doing a lot of work that will be thrown away afterwards.

### I saw you speak last year, at the [Frontend North East conference](https://2018.frontendne.co.uk/), and you were telling the audience how amazing VSCode is. Can you share some of that awesomeness for us here?

It is so exciting to see how [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) took the whole front-end development market by storm. And with good reason. It is a lightweight text editor that gives you features you only expect from much larger IDEs. Set up correctly, it is an amazing boost to your productivity as you don’t need to jump between editor, terminal and browser any longer. It has built-in linting, telling you what the bugs and issues in your code are whilst you are writing it rather than after the fact and in a debugging stage. And it is open source, written in TypeScript and extensible to your needs and likes. I am incredibly happy that it became the huge success it is, as it was a big bet for a company like Microsoft to release something this open and in collaboration with other companies. 

I love starting new developers with VSCode, as they can concentrate on writing code rather than spending most of their time configuring various different environments. I really wished I’d have had something like that when I started coding. I am not too keen on huge IDEs and closed development chains, but something this flexible and easy to configure to exactly the right needs for the current project is something great.
 
To me, having an editor that guides your coding style and tests the quality of it while it is being written is an amazing opportunity. This is also why I made it a big part of my [JavaScript course on Skillshare](http://skl.sh/christian_javascript).

### Other than VS Code, what does your local development environment look like? What are your 'must have' desktop and mobile app's? 

I have not “one dev environment”. I use a Dell XPS 15 with Windows 10, VSCode, Ubuntu shell and that’s about it. The rest is online using GitHub. I also use a MacBook Pro (the old version without the touchbar) and don’t really have a preference as I got used to both. 

In terms of productivity I love using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) for my files and folders, [GitHub](https://github.com/) for collaboration and that’s kind of it. I love [Hemingwayapp](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to help with my writing and Office 365 for collaboration on documents. I really live 90% of my work life in browsers rather than apps. Nowadays our tech stack on the web is good enough to do that. Using GitHub helps you a lot with your day-to-day work. I’ve given up trusting hardware and local storing of files. It is always a good idea to keep a remote copy.
 
### How do you see web, or more specifically javascript, development changing over the next 5 or 10 years?

One of the things we have to embrace is that we are not safe from automation either. I think that what we call coding now is not at all what is needed for the market. End users expect a lot less from our products than we think - in essence they want the thing to work. Our job is to build things that allow people to do their jobs - not the other way around. Right now the JavaScript world is in a huge hype cycle and it is not sensible or safe. We have to find a way to prune the over-use and over-reliance on hand-crafted JavaScript, as nobody wants to maintain it. We also have to find a way to create and use reusable components that are tested, clean and secure - not just convenient. It is terrible how we rely on random NPM packages that create incredibly deep dependency chains for simple tasks and it is borderline criminal how we don’t concentrate on maintenance and simple upgrade paths without breaking functionality. Any outdated package is a possible attack vector, any “quick hack” that is undocumented will become a problem in the very near future. We need to grow up and become more professional as a community and understand that how excited we are as developers isn’t what our end users need. They need things that work and that may require us to do more work, or to embrace new(ish) ideas like machine learning and code creation from components. We do much bigger things in JavaScript than we’ve ever done before and people rely on our skills. So let’s not get too excited by how much we can do, but what we should do and how we make sure it doesn’t blow up in our face very soon.
 
### If you were to recommend one must watch talk, either than you have given or that you have heard, what would that be?

Oh that is a tough one as there are far too many to mention. I keep posting about great talks on my [blog](https://christianheilmann.com/) and on [social media](https://twitter.com/codepo8), so make sure to follow me to get them. 

As for my own talks, I am pretty proud of the “killing the golden calf of coding” opening keynote of WeAreDevelopers, where I talk about the automation of our jobs using machine learning:

Also, if you want to watch a talk to make you happy about the future of computing and programming, I am a huge fan of Linda Liukas’ “One hundred languages” talk at Trondheilm Developer Conference:

### Do you have any hobbies outside the computer?

I love theatre and movies. And books. And cycling. 
 
### If you could be on a reality show or sitcom which one would you want to be on?

Mythbusters. Pretend to apply logic and physics and when it doesn’t work, blow things up. 

### If you were stranded on a desert island, what three things would you take with you?

Sunscreen (I’m a redhead, duh!), lots of books and a boat to leave the island (I like being prepared). 
 
### Is there anything else you would like to say?

Don’t get overwhelmed with all the technological offerings we have these days. It is important to understand how your skills mesh with others and respect them for theirs. There is no way you can know everything and there is no shame in not being interested in things that you don’t see being your cup of tea.
